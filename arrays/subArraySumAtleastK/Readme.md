## Sub array sum greater than or equal to K

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the size of the smallest continuous subarrays whose sum equalsis equal to or greater than K.
```
Example 1:
Input:nums = [-1,4, -1], k = 4
Output: 1 => [4]
```

```
Example 2:
Input:nums = [-1,2,2,0, -1], k = 4
Output: 2 => [2,2]
```

```
Example 3:
Input:nums = [-1,3,-1,2, -1], k = 4
Output: 3 => [3,-1,2]
```

```
Example 4:
Input:nums = ip = [-1,3,-1,-2,-1, -1], k = -4
Output: 3 => [-1,-2,-1]
```

Note:  
- The array may contain positive or negative numbers.
- The target may be a positive of negative number.
