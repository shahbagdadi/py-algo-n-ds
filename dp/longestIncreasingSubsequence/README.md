## Longest increasing subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
```
Example 1:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 


Example 2:

Input : [4,10,4,3,8,9]
Output : 3
Explanation : 4,8,9 or 3,8,9
```
Note:  

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.  
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
